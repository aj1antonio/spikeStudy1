                    <h2> Sprint spikes are designed to put an athlete on his or her toes and, to save weight, have little or no heel.
                         The spike plate (the forefoot platform into which pins are mounted) of a sprint shoe also has the maximum number of pins to provide as much traction as possible.</h2>
                         <p>For the shorter distances like the 100 meter, 200 meter and 400 meter, speed is paramount. Use sprinter spiked shoes, which are very lightweight and designed for speed. They have five to eight spikes that can be interchanged with studs or other spikes of varying sizes and shapes. Spikes can come in sizes as small as 3 mm, used primarily for indoor events, to 7 mm for outdoor tracks. Rounded studs will not grip nearly as well as spikes on a good surface.
                              For short sprints on surfaces in good condition, 3 mm to 5 mm pyramid-shaped spikes will give you adequate grip and acceleration.</p>

                    <h2>Long Jump Spikes are specially designed to allow an athlete to maximise their acceleration and speed during the run up. The flat sole of the spike will also provide the athlete with comfort and leverage to take-off it the correct position at the board.
                        Long Jump spikes also provide more support to your ankle and feet.</h2>
                        <h3>Triple Jump athletes use the whole sole of their feet when jumping so triple jump spikes will have support and cushioning throughout the full length of the spike. Triple Jump spikes have a secure fit to ensure the foot does not move too much during each phase of the jump.</h3>
                         <p>High Jump spikes provide athletes with a lot of support to their ankles during the run up and take off.
                            High Jump spikes are different to running spikes as you will find up four spikes on the heel part of the spike.
                             This is because High Jumpers during take off will place their foot heel first so the additional spikes provide maximum grip in any weather/track conditions.</p>

                    <h2> While quarter-inch pins are the norm for use on a track, three-eighth-inch pins are standard for cross country. However, muddy conditions call for a longer pin, say, a half-inch or five-eighths of an inch. For a course with lots of pavement or very firm dirt, it's best to insert plugs in place of the pins. Specialty running shoe stores and the Web are the best bets for finding extra pins and plugs. Cross-country flats, which have rubber nubs where pins would be in a spiked shoe, are another alternative.</h2>
                         <p>Distance spikes usally always are as light as they can be and also usually have less pens in the bottom of the spike anywhere from 3-7 pins.</p>
